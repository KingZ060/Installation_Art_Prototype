        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <br />
        The program is a facial recognition prototype. When in use, the program gives real-time feedback based on the user's expression. The “Emotion Mirror” can be installed in high-traffic areas to adjust the lighting, temperature, music, etc. in real time according to the mood of the people in the vicinity; for example, in large shopping malls or shopping centers, which not only enhances the visitors' experience, but also allows customers to interact with each other. Ideally, the installation should be in a spacious and well-lit space, so that the camera can focus better on highlighting each user's face.

        Hardware list: This project relies on two main pieces of hardware: the HD camera and the computer (processor). Other hardware is not necessary and depends on the comfort level; e.g. display, aesthetic lighting elements, etc. The exact cost will vary depending on the different components used and the different environments. For an event in a large shopping center, several high-precision cameras may be needed to better illuminate each customer. But in a small room, such as a classroom, a small laptop and a webcam can keep costs down.

        Immersive Experience Design: To enhance its immersive experience, my plan focuses on two main areas. First, on the auditory side, I will use subtle sound effects to accompany my program, setting different sound effects for different moods and playing them at corresponding times. The sound effects will be used to improve the participant's experience. Beyond that, I would like to add more visual effects to enhance the experience, such as adding shape projections or lighting that changes color depending on the mood, etc. to improve the immersive experience for the participants.

        While working on this project, asked chatgpt questions about JavaScript face tracking etc. and learned how to use the external library face-api. Citations in img folder.
